Prequisites:
    A working python 2 installation (python 3 probably also works) with numpy and pyplot.

Notes:
    There's is no implementation for reading data from files or generating data
    randomly for two circles, as this seemed to contradict the requirement to
    generated data from a few areas in the unit circle. This functionality could
    of course be added very easily.

Running:
    The module can be run using
        python MSOM.py
    this will run a short demonstration of the implemented functionality.


Documentation:
    More documentation can be found within MSOM.py itself.


Plotting
    When running the demo, an image is displayed showing the state of the MSOM
    after training is completed. This requires python-tk and is therefore disabled by default.
    This image for one particular run is also included in the folder as 'plot.png'.
