To run the code, use:
    python Robot.py
this will execute 50000 simulations and print the found values for F.

For each starting position, the average numbers of required moves, 
the amount of completed simulations, and the algebraically calculated correct answer is printed:
    F(i):   <avg number of moves based on simulations> (# simulations) (<avg number of moves based on exact calculation>)

A sample outcome can be found in 'sample_result.dat'.
